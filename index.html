                <dd>Food webs are complex ecological networks whose
            structure is both ecologically and statistically
            constrained, with many network properties being correlated
            with each other. Despite the recognition of these invariable
            relationships in food webs, the use of the principle of
            maximum entropy (MaxEnt) in network ecology is still rare.
            This is surprising considering that MaxEnt is a statistical
            tool precisely designed for understanding and predicting
            many different types of constrained systems. Precisely, this
            principle asserts that the least-biased probability
            distribution of a system’s property, constrained by prior
            knowledge about that system, is the one with maximum
            information entropy. MaxEnt has been proven useful in many
            ecological modelling problems, but its application in food
            webs and other ecological networks is limited. Here we show
            how MaxEnt can be used to derive many food-web properties
            both analytically and heuristically. First, we show how the
            joint degree distribution (the joint probability
            distribution of the numbers of prey and predators for each
            species in the network) can be derived analytically using
            the number of species and the number of interactions in food
            webs. Second, we present a heuristic and flexible approach
            of finding a network’s adjacency matrix (the network’s
            representation in matrix format) based on simulated
            annealing and SVD entropy. We built two heuristic models
            using the connectance and the joint degree sequence as
            statistical constraints, respectively. We compared both
            models’ predictions against corresponding null and neutral
            models commonly used in network ecology using open access
            data of terrestrial and aquatic food webs sampled globally
            (N = 257). We found that the heuristic model constrained by
            the joint degree sequence was a good predictor of many
            measures of food-web structure, especially the nestedness
            and motifs distribution. Specifically, our results suggest
            that the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food webs is
            mainly driven by their joint degree distribution.</dd>
                    <dt>Author Summary</dt>
                <dd>Predator and prey species form complex networks of
            energy flow that drive the functioning and dynamics of
            ecosystems. Because of their high number and variability,
            sampling and documenting these feeding relationships are
            particularly challenging, especially at large spatial and
            temporal scales. Fortunately, many properties of food webs
            can be studied without knowing every trophic interaction in
            a network by using suitable computational methods. This is
            notably the case of their emerging structure, which could be
            driven by just a few ecological and biological variables
            despite the large number of mechanisms shaping ecological
            networks. In this contribution, we present a novel framework
            to identify these variables by applying the principle of
            maximum entropy to the analysis of food-web structure. We
            show that the number of prey and predators for each species
            in a food web is a fundamental property that shape many
            aspects of the network, while also being predictable by our
            model and available data. Our approach, which can be applied
            to a wide range of biological and ecological networks, can
            be used to make better predictions of food webs across
            space, in addition to contributing to our understanding of
            the ecological processes shaping predatory interactions at
            the community level.</dd>

            constrained structure of ecological networks</h2>
            <p>A variety of measures of the structure of ecological
            networks have been used to describe the organization of
            species interactions in a biological community (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Delmas2019AnaEco">Delmas <em>et
            al.</em> (2019)</span>). These measures provide valuable
            information on the functioning of ecosystems and their
            responses to environmental change (e.g. <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Pascual2006EcoNeta">Pascual
            &amp; Dunne (2006)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Gomez2011FunConb">Gómez <em>et al.</em>
            (2011)</span>). For instance, two main properties of a
            network are its order (the number of nodes or species <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>) and its size (the
            number of edges or species interactions <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>), whose ratio <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em>/<em>S</em><sup>2</sup></span>
            (the proportion of possible interactions that are realized)
            is called connectance. In food webs, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dunne2002NetStrb">Dunne <em>et al.</em>
            (2002)</span> showed that a high connectance can promote the
            robustness of the community to species lost. Moreover, a
            different investigation of network structure revealed that
            plant–pollinator and seed-disperser networks have a highly
            nested structure that can promote species persistence (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Bascompte2003NesAssa">Bascompte
            <em>et al.</em> (2003)</span>). Despite the recognition of
            the ecological significance of network structure, our
            knowledge of the properties of ecological networks remains
            limited and is unevenly distributed across space (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2021GloKno">Poisot <em>et
            al.</em> (2021)</span>). This can largely be attributed to
            the difficulties encountered when sampling interactions
            (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Jordano2016SamNeta">Jordano (2016)</span>),
            which impede our ability to describe network structure on a
            global scale. Moreover, these complex systems (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Williams2000SimRul">Williams
            &amp; Martinez (2000)</span>) have an emerging structure
            with intricate dynamics (i.e. non-linear behaviors that
            cannot be predicted from individual interactions). Their
            multi-faceted nature and high level of complexity represent
            a challenge when studying the ecological processes driving
            their structure, especially given the strong relationship
            between many of their properties. For example, nestedness
            and modularity are highly correlated in ecological networks
            (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fortuna2010NesMod">Fortuna <em>et al.</em>
            (2010)</span>) and many emerging properties are linked to
            connectance (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2014WheEcoa">Poisot &amp; Gravel
            (2014)</span>). In light of these observations, it is
            difficult to assess whether the presumed effects of a
            particular measure on network structure and behavior are the
            artifacts of other, perhaps simpler, measures.</p>
            <p>One way to address this issue is to recognize that food
            webs and other ecological networks are constrained systems.
            In other words, the space of possible network configurations
            is shaped by our partial knowledge of their structure. For
            example, there is a finite set of networks with a given
            number of species and interactions (i.e. a given
            connectance). As shown by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2014WheEcoa">Poisot &amp; Gravel
            (2014)</span>, connectance can constrain many aspects of
            network structure such as the degree distribution (i.e. the
            probability distribution of the number of interactions
            realized by a species). Because of the scaling relationship
            between the total number of species and interactions,
            network structure is also largely constrained by its order
            (food webs with high species richness typically have a low
            connectance compared to smaller networks, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">MacDonald
            <em>et al.</em> (2020)</span>). Other measures, such as the
            maximum trophic level (i.e. the maximum number of times
            energy is transformed along food chains through biomass
            consumption), may also constrain the space of feasible
            networks, e.g. by imposing a limit on energy transfer (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Williams2004LimTro">Williams
            &amp; Martinez (2004)</span>).</p>
            <p>Prior knowledge of the structure of ecological networks,
            even partial, can be useful in the current context of data
            scarcity about species interactions. The Eltonian shortfall,
            which describes the gap between our present-day knowledge of
            ecological networks and a comprehensive understanding of
            interactions (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Hortal2015SevSho">Hortal <em>et al.</em>
            (2015)</span>), can be partially alleviated using known
            information about a network’s attributes. First, knowing a
            given set of network properties (e.g. the number of species
            and interactions), it is possible to identify various
            structures that meet these constraints and estimate their
            respective probabilities of occurrence. For instance, a set
            of adjacency matrices (i.e. a representation of interactions
            in matrix format) that satisfy the known properties can be
            found. Selecting the right adjacency matrix among all of
            these suitable configurations or evaluating their relative
            probabilities may be done using different modeling tools
            (e.g. using the principle of maximum entropy or Bayesian
            inference). Second, as suggested by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021a)</span>, network structure can also be used to
            facilitate the estimation of pairwise species interactions.
            For example, by knowing a network’s adjacency matrix (or the
            constrained space of feasible networks), we can decrease the
            volume of information we need to infer interactions (e.g. by
            knowing how many prey each species should have). Moreover,
            network structure can be used as validation to ensure that
            inferred interactions collectively satisfy known structural
            properties. Overall, partial knowledge of a network’s
            properties can help us reconstruct its emerging structure
            and individual interactions when data is lacking.</p>
            <p>Predicting ecological networks and understanding the
            biological mechanisms that shape species interactions are
            two complementary aims of network ecology. On one hand,
            prediction is the process of estimating the value of an
            unknown variable using available data and appropriate
            statistical models and assumptions. The goal of predictive
            models is to minimize predictive errors and provide reliable
            estimates of the unknown variable. These models have the
            potential to fill many data gaps about species interactions
            and network structure by making sound predictions and
            generating new data. A variety of such models have recently
            been developed using machine learning and other statistical
            tools, most of which are presented in <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021a)</span>. On the other hand, statistical models can
            also be built to describe or understand a parameter or
            mechanism of interest. For example, null models are
            statistical models that generate baseline distributions to
            evaluate the significance of an observed measure. These
            distributions are obtained from different randomizations of
            a network that maintain some of its properties while
            deliberately omitting others. By assessing the deviation of
            empirical data from these reference distributions, we can
            evaluate the degree to which the processes underlying the
            null model can accurately capture the observed measures,
            providing a benchmark to assess the importance of additional
            factors such as the omitted properties (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Fortuna2006HabLos">Fortuna

            data-cites="Delmas2019AnaEco">Delmas <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span>). This makes null models a valuable tool to
            identify the ecological mechanisms that drive species
            interactions and constrain the structure of ecological
            networks. The distinction between understanding and
            predicting is crucial when using statistical and
            mathematical models as this can impact how we use and
            interpret them. Numerous predictive and null models have
            been used to analyze ecological networks (<span

            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021a)</span>). Nevertheless, given the constrained nature
            of ecological networks, it is surprising that the principle
            of maximum entropy, a mathematical method designed for both
            the description and prediction of constrained systems, has
            been barely used in network ecology.</p>

            <p>The principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) is a
            mathematical method of finding probability distributions,
            strongly rooted in statistical mechanics and information

            data-cites="Harremoes2001MaxEnt">Harremoës &amp; Topsøe
            (2001)</span>). Starting from a set of constraints given by
            prior knowledge of a system (i.e. what we call state
            variables), this method helps us find least-biased
            probability distributions subject to the constraints. These
            probability distributions are guaranteed to be unique given
            our prior knowledge and represent the most we can say about
            a system without making more assumptions. For example, if we
            know the number of species and total number of individuals
            in a biological community (our state variables), we can
            calculate the average number of individuals per species (our
            constraint). Using the principle of maximum entropy, one
            could show that the least-biased species abundance
            distribution (i.e. the distribution of the number of
            individuals of each species), constrained by the average
            species abundance, follows an exponential distribution whose
            parameter is determined by the values of the state variables
            (<span class="citation" data-cites="Frank2011SimDera">Frank

            (2014)</span>). However, this does not imply that this
            distribution will be the best fit to empirical data. The
            challenge is to find the right set of constraints that would
            best reproduce distributions found in nature.</p>
            <p>MaxEnt states that the least-biased probability
            distribution given the constraints used is the one with the
            highest entropy (a measure of the uncertainty of a random
            process) among all probability distributions that satisfy
            these constraints. Many measures of entropy have been
            developed in physics (<span class="citation"

            generate null models of network structure with either fixed
            or fluctuating constraints (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Caruso2022FluEco">Caruso <em>et al.</em>
            (2022)</span>) and predict important network properties
            using limited data. For example, it has been used to predict
            the degree distribution of bipartite networks from the
            number of species and the number of interactions (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">Williams
            (2011)</span>) and the strength of biotic interactions from

            data-cites="Stock2021OptTra">Stock <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>). However, to the best of our knowledge,
            MaxEnt has never been used to predict food-web structure
            directly, even though food webs are among the most
            documented and widespread ecological networks (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Ings2009RevEco">Ings <em>et
            al.</em> (2009)</span>).</p>
            <p>Food-web properties that can be derived using MaxEnt are
            varied and pertain to different elements of the network
            (i.e. at the species, interaction and community levels).
            Because MaxEnt is a method of finding least-biased
            probability distributions given partial knowledge about a
            system, these properties need to be represented
            probabilistically. For example, at the species level, MaxEnt
            can be used to predict the distribution of trophic levels
            among species, as well as the distribution of species’
            vulnerability (number of predators) and generality (number
            of prey). By contrast, at the interaction level, predictions
            can be made on the distribution of interaction strengths in
            weighted food webs. At the community level, it can generate
            probability distributions of many measures of a network’s
            emerging structure and of networks themselves (i.e. a
            probability distribution governing the occurrence of
            different network configurations). Because the decomposition
            of a network’s adjacency matrix into a product of matrices
            can yield a vector of relative values (e.g. a vector of
            relative singular values), MaxEnt can also be used to find
            the configuration whose distribution of relative values is
            of maximum entropy. This configuration would be the one with
            the greatest entropy (or complexity, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021SvdEnt">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021b)</span>) among all configurations that satisfy the
            constraints. Overall, the potential of this method in the
            study of food webs is broad. The applicability and
            performance of MaxEnt mostly depend on the ecological
            information available and on our capacity to find the right
            set of state variables that best represent natural systems
            and to translate them into appropriate statistical
            constraints. Having a validated maximum entropy model for
            the system at hand allows us to make least-biased
            predictions using a minimal amount of data, as well as
            identify the most important ecological processes shaping
            that system. In other words, MaxEnt can help us better
            understand and predict the structure of ecological networks
            worldwide.</p>
            <h2 id="analytical-and-heuristic-approaches">Analytical and
            heuristic approaches</h2>
            <p>In this contribution, we used two complementary
            approaches to predict the structure of food webs using the
            principle of maximum entropy. The first approach consists in
            deriving constrained probability distributions of given
            network properties analytically, whereas the second approach
            consists in finding the adjacency matrix of maximum entropy
            heuristically, from which network properties can be
            measured. We compared our predictions against empirical data
            and null and neutral models commonly used in network
            ecology. We focus on deterministic (non-probabilistic) and
            unweighted (Boolean) food webs in both approaches for two
            reasons. (1) Most sampled food webs lack estimates of
            interaction probabilities (e.g. spatial variability of
            interactions) and strengths (e.g. energy fluxes between
            species) because of inherent difficulties in measurement.
            (2) The methods and measures to analyze the structure of
            binary food webs are more developed and tested (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Delmas2019AnaEco">Delmas <em>et
            al.</em> (2019)</span>), which increases the range of
            analysis we can perform and simplifies their interpretation.
            However, our framework can be applied to all types of
            ecological networks and a wider variety of measures.</p>
            <p>For the first approach (analytic), we focus on
            species-level properties. Specifically, we derived the joint
            degree distribution (i.e. the joint probability distribution
            that a species has a given number of prey and predators in
            its network) of maximum entropy using only the number of
            species <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> and the
            number of interactions <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> as state variables.
            Then, we calculated the degree distribution of maximum
            entropy directly from the joint degree distribution by
            summing probabilities over the joint degree distribution
            (since the degree of a species is its total number of prey
            and predators combined). Because of the scarcity of
            empirical data on the number of interactions in food webs,
            we also present a method to predict <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> from <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> (Box 1), thus allowing
            the prediction of the joint degree distribution from <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> solely.</p>
            <p>For the second approach (heuristic), we focus on
            community-level properties. We used a flexible and heuristic
            model based on simulated annealing (an optimization
            algorithm, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kirkpatrick1983OptSim">Kirkpatrick <em>et
            al.</em> (1983)</span>) to find the network configuration
            <em>close</em> to maximum entropy and measured its
            structure. We developed this heuristic model because the
            analytical derivation of a maximum entropy graph model of
            food webs is difficult, and because this model is readily
            applicable to other types of ecological networks and
            measures. Indeed, the mathematical representation of food
            webs (i.e. directed simple graphs frequently having
            self-loops) makes the optimization of maximum entropy graph
            models more complicated than with many other types of
            (non-ecological) networks. In other words, deriving a
            probability distribution on the graphs themselves is
            difficult when working with food webs. We built two types of
            heuristic MaxEnt models depending on the constraint used.
            Our type I MaxEnt model uses the connectance of the network
            (i.e. the ratio <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em>/<em>S</em><sup>2</sup></span>)
            as a constraint, whereas our type II MaxEnt model uses the
            whole joint degree sequence as a constraint.</p>

            maximum entropy models</h2>
            <p>The analytical approach is the most common way to use and
            develop maximum entropy models. As shown above, starting
            from a defined set of constraints, a mathematical expression
            for the target distribution is derived using the method of
            Lagrange multipliers. The derived distribution of maximum
            entropy is unique and least biased given the constraints
            used. Although we refer to this approach as analytic,
            finding the values of the Lagrange multipliers usually
            requires the use of numerical methods. Here we use MaxEnt to
            derive two species-level properties in food webs: the joint
            degree distribution and the degree distribution. The degree
            distribution has driven the attention of ecologists because
            of its role in determining the assembly of ecological
            networks (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Vazquez2005DegDisa">Vázquez (2005)</span>),
            shaping their emerging structure (<span class="citation"

            (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">Williams (2011)</span>). As
            noted above, although the degree distribution of maximum
            entropy has already been derived in bipartite networks
            (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">Williams (2011)</span>), we
            show in much greater detail its mathematical derivation in
            food webs. But first, we derived the joint degree
            distribution, a related property that holds significantly
            more ecological information than the degree
            distribution.</p>
            <p>We tested our analytical MaxEnt models against open
            food-web data queried from three different sources and
            integrated into what we call our <em>complete dataset</em>.
            These sources include (1) terrestrial and aquatic food webs
            sampled globally and archived on the ecological interactions
            database Mangal; (2) freshwater stream food webs from New
            Zealand; and (3) aquatic food webs from Tuesday Lake
            (Michigan, United States). First, all food webs archived on
            <code>mangal.io</code> (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2016ManMakb">Poisot <em>et al.</em>

            data-cites="Banville2021ManJla">Banville <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span>) were directly queried from the database
            (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em> = 235</span>). Most
            ecological networks archived on Mangal are multilayer
            networks, i.e. networks that describe different types of
            interactions. We kept all networks whose interactions were
            mainly of predation and herbivory types and removed the
            largest network (<span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em> = 714</span>) for
            computational efficiency reasons. Then, to this set, we
            added food webs from two different sources: the New Zealand
            dataset (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em> = 21</span>,
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Pomeranz2018DatInf">Pomeranz <em>et al.</em>
            (2018)</span>) and the Tuesday Lake dataset (<span

            class="citation" data-cites="Cohen2003EcoComa">Cohen <em>et
            al.</em> (2003)</span>). Our complete dataset thus contained
            a total of <span class="math inline">257</span> food webs.
            These complex food webs differ in their level of resolution
            and sampling effort, which may introduce noise in the
            estimation of their properties, especially given their large
            number of interacting elements. However, because our MaxEnt
            models are applied on imperfect data, they aim at
            reproducing the <em>sampled</em> structure of food webs, not
            their actual structure. All code and data to reproduce this
            article are available in the Open Science Framework
            (OSF.IO/KT4GS). Data cleaning, simulations and analyses were
            conducted in Julia v1.8.0.</p>

            discrete probability distribution describing the probability
            that a species has <span

            predators and <span

            prey, with <span

            <p>The first constraint <span
            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span> is our
            normalizing constraint, whereas the other two (<span

            class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>3</sub></span>) fix the

            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            to the linkage density <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em>/<em>S</em></span>. It is
            important to notice that <span
            class="math inline">⟨<em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub>⟩ = ⟨<em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub>⟩</span>
            because every edge is associated with a predator and a prey.
            Therefore, without using any further constraints, we would
            expect the joint degree distribution of maximum entropy to
            be a symmetric probability distribution with regards to
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>.
            However, this does not mean that the joint degree
            <em>sequence</em> will be symmetric since the joint degree
            sequence is a random realization of its probabilistic
            counterpart.</p>
            <p>The joint probability distribution of maximum entropy
            given these constraints is found using the method of
            Lagrange multipliers. To do so, we seek to maximize the
            following expression:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:F_jdd"><span class="math display">$$F = H -
            \lambda_1(g_1-1)-\lambda_2\left( g_2-\frac{L}{S}\right) -

            g_3-\frac{L}{S}\right),\qquad{(7)}$$</span></span></p>
            <p>where <span
            class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span
            class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span
            class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>3</sub></span> are the
            Lagrange multipliers. The probability distribution that
            maximizes entropy is obtained by finding these values. As
            pointed out above, <span
            class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is just Shannon’s
            entropy to which we added terms that each sums to zero (our
            constraints). <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is
            maximized by setting to 0 its partial derivative with

            class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub>,<em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub>)</span>.
            Because the derivative of a constant is zero, this gives

            is called the partition function. The partition function
            ensures that probabilities sum to 1 (our normalization

            The estimated values of <span

            the joint degree distribution.</p>
            <p>We assessed the empirical support of this expression
            using all food webs in our complete dataset. First, we
            predicted the joint degree distribution of maximum entropy
            for each of these food webs, i.e. using their number of
            species and number of interactions as state variables. Then,
            we sampled one realization of the joint degree sequence for
            each network using the probabilities given by the joint
            degree distribution, while fixing the total number of
            interactions. This gave us a random realization of the
            number of prey and predators for each node in each network.
            We standardized the predicted <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            by the total number of species in their network to generate
            relative values, which can be compared across networks.</p>
            <h3 id="degree-distribution">Degree distribution</h3>
            <p>The joint degree distribution derived using MaxEnt
            (eq. 10) can be used to obtain the degree distribution of
            maximum entropy. The degree distribution <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>k</em>)</span> represents
            the probability that a species has <span

            class="math inline"><em>k</em> = <em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> + <em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>.
            It can thus be obtained from the joint degree distribution
            as follows:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">$$p(k) = \sum_{i=0}^k p(k_{in}
            = k - i, k_{out} = i).$$</span></p>
            <p>The degree distribution can also be obtained directly
            using the principle of maximum entropy, as discussed in
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">Williams (2011)</span>. This
            gives the following distribution:</p>

            <p>with <span class="math inline">$Z = \sum_{k=0}^S
            e^{-\lambda_2k}.$</span></p>
            <p>This can be solved numerically using the constraint of
            the average degree <span class="math inline">$\langle k
            \rangle = \frac{2L}{S}$</span> of a species, yielding an
            identical solution to the one obtained using the joint

            <p>Note that the mean degree is twice the value of the
            linkage density because every interaction must be counted
            twice when we add in and out-degrees together.</p>
            <h2 id="heuristic-maximum-entropy-models">Heuristic maximum
            entropy models</h2>
            <p>With the analytical approach, we showed how important
            measures of food-web structure (e.g. the degree distribution
            and the joint degree distribution) can be derived with the
            principle of maximum entropy using minimal knowledge about a
            biological community. This type of model, although useful to
            make least-biased predictions of many network properties,
            can be hard to apply for other measures. There are dozens of
            measures of network structure (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Delmas2019AnaEco">Delmas <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span>) and many are not directly calculated with
            mathematical equations but are instead estimated
            algorithmically. Moreover, the applicability of this method
            to empirical systems is limited by the state variables we
            can measure and use. Here, we suggest a more flexible method
            to predict many measures of network structure
            simultaneously, i.e. by finding heuristically the network
            configuration of maximum SVD (singular value decomposition)
            entropy given partial knowledge of its emerging
            structure.</p>

            entropy</h3>
            <p>The principle of maximum entropy can be applied on the
            network itself if we decompose its adjacency matrix into a
            non-zero vector of relative values. This is a necessary step
            when working with food webs, which are frequently expressed
            as a matrix <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em> = [<em>a</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub>]</span>

            of an interaction between two species <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>. Knowing one or many
            properties of a food web of interest (e.g. its number of
            species and number of interactions), we can simulate its
            adjacency matrix randomly by using this known ecological
            information to constrain the space of potential networks.
            The entropy of this hypothetical matrix can then be measured
            after decomposing it into appropriate values. Simulating a
            series of networks until we find the one having the highest
            entropy allows us to search for the most complex food-web
            configuration given the ecological constraints used. This
            configuration is the least-biased one considering the
            information available. In other words, the most we can say
            about a network’s adjacency matrix, without making more
            assumptions than the ones given by our incomplete knowledge
            of its structure, is the one of maximum entropy. Generating
            the most complex network that corresponds to this structure
            allows us to explore more easily other properties of food
            webs under MaxEnt.</p>
            <p>Shannon’s entropy can only be calculated on conventional
            probability distributions such as the joint degree
            distribution. This is an issue when working with the
            adjacency matrix of ecological networks. For this reason, we
            need to use another measure of entropy if we want to predict
            a network’s configuration directly using MaxEnt. We used the
            SVD entropy as our measure of entropy, which is an
            application of Shannon’s entropy to the relative non-zero
            singular values of a food web’s adjacency matrix (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2021SvdEnt">Strydom
            <em>et al.</em> (2021b)</span>). These values are obtained
            by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on the
            matrix. SVD is a mathematical method that decomposes a
            matrix into three separate matrices, one of which contains
            singular values on the diagonal. We selected the non-zero
            singular values (i.e. the informative singular values that
            reflect a non-negligible contribution to the structure of
            the matrix) by keeping the largest <span
            class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> values, where <span
            class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> is the rank of the
            matrix (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Golub1987GenEck">Golub <em>et al.</em>
            (1987)</span>). We measured SVD entropy as follows:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:svd-entropy"><span class="math display">$$J
            = -\sum_{i=1}^R s_i \log
            s_i,\qquad{(16)}$$</span></span></p>
            <p>where <span
            class="math inline"><em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>
            are the relative singular values of the adjacency matrix
            (<span class="math inline">$s_i = \sigma_i / \sum_{i = 1}^R
            \sigma_i$</span>, where <span
            class="math inline"><em>σ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>
            are the singular values). Note that the distribution of
            relative singular values is analogous to a probability
            distribution, with <span
            class="math inline">0 &lt; <em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> &lt; 1</span>
            and <span
            class="math inline">∑<em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = 1</span>.
            This measure also satisfies all four properties of an
            appropriate entropy measure above-mentioned, while being a
            proper measure of the internal complexity of food webs

            <p>We used SVD entropy to predict the network configuration
            of maximum entropy (i.e. of maximum complexity)
            heuristically given different constraints for all food webs
            in our complete dataset. We built two types of heuristic
            MaxEnt models that differ on the constraint used. The type I
            heuristic MaxEnt model is based on connectance, whereas the
            type II heuristic MaxEnt model is based on the joint degree
            sequence. These models are thus based on the same
            constraints as the types I (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fortuna2006HabLos">Fortuna &amp; Bascompte
            (2006)</span>) and II (<span class="citation"

            generate random networks topologically. This allows a direct
            comparison of the performance of null and heuristic MaxEnt
            models in reproducing the emerging structure of empirical
            food webs.</p>
            <p>For each network, we estimated their configuration of
            maximum entropy given each of these constraints. For both
            types of heuristic MaxEnt models, we used a simulated
            annealing algorithm with <span class="math inline">4</span>
            chains, <span class="math inline">2000</span> steps and an
            initial temperature of <span class="math inline">0.2</span>.
            For each food web, we first generated one random Boolean
            matrix per chain while fixing the number of species. We also
            maintained the total number of interactions (i.e. the sum of
            all elements in the matrix) in the type I MaxEnt model and
            the joint degree sequence (i.e. the rows and columns sums)
            in the type II MaxEnt model. These were our initial
            configurations. Then, we swapped interactions sequentially
            while maintaining the original connectance or joint degree
            sequence. Configurations with a higher SVD entropy than the
            previous one in the chain were always accepted, whereas they
            were accepted with a probability conditional to a decreasing
            temperature and the difference in SVD entropy when lower.
            The final configuration with the highest SVD entropy among
            the four chains constitutes the estimated maximum entropy
            configuration of a food web given the constraint used.</p>

            <p>We compared the performance of both heuristic MaxEnt
            models in predicting these measures to the one of the null
            and neutral models (Box 2). We conducted these comparisons
            using two different datasets: (1) our complete dataset
            including most food webs archived on Mangal, as well as all
            food webs in the New Zealand and Tuesday Lake datasets, and
            (2) our <em>abundance dataset</em>, a subset of the complete

            species’ relative abundances (<span

            class="math inline">19</span> networks had data on species’
            relative abundances that were used in the neutral model to
            better assess the performance of our heuristic models. We
            compared our models’ predictions using these two datasets
            separately to minimize biases and to better represent food

            1 - Working with predicted numbers of interactions</h1>
            <p>Our analytical MaxEnt models require information on the
            number of species and the number of interactions. However,
            since the latter is rarely measured empirically, ecologists
            might need to use another predictive model to estimate the
            total number of interactions in a food web before using
            MaxEnt. Here we show how this can be done by combining both
            models sequentially.</p>
            <p>We used the flexible links model of <span
            class="citation" data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">MacDonald
            <em>et al.</em> (2020)</span> to predict the number of
            interactions from the number of species in food webs. The
            flexible links model has been shown to make reliable
            predictions of <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>
            while taking into account meaningful ecological constraints
            on its lower and upper bounds. Specifically, recognizing
            that there is a minimum of <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span> (if no isolated
            species) and a maximum of <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em><sup>2</sup></span> (if all
            species interact) interactions in food webs, it estimates
            the number of the <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em><sup>2</sup> − (<em>S</em>−1)</span>
            <em>flexible links</em> that are realized. This represents
            the number of realized interactions above the minimum
            (i.e. <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub><em>F</em><em>L</em></sub> = <em>L</em> − (<em>S</em>−1)</span>).
            The probability that a flexible link is realized is treated
            as constant within a particular food web but differs across
            food webs to capture variations in connectance. Therefore,
            assuming that flexible links are independent Bernoulli
            events, the total number of flexible links that are realized
            in a food web can be obtained from a beta-binomial

            <p>We generated probabilistic networks using both types of
            null models for all empirical food webs in our complete
            dataset. Then, we converted these networks to adjacency

            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> given by the number of
            interactions in each food web. This ensured that the
            resulting null networks had the same number of interactions
            as their empirical counterparts. Thus, for each null model,
            we ended up with one null adjacency matrix for each

            <p>We first discuss the predictive capacity of our
            analytical models. The relationship between the relative
            numbers of prey <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and predators <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            in empirical networks and obtained from the joint degree
            distributions of maximum entropy is depicted in the left and
            central panels of fig. 2, respectively. We observe that our
            analytical model predicts higher values of generality and
            vulnerability compared to empirical food webs (i.e. relative
            values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span

            both closer to <span class="math inline">1</span>) for many
            species. In other words, our model predicts that species
            that have many predators also have more prey than what is
            observed empirically (and conversely). This is not
            surprising, given that our model did not include biological
            factors preventing generalist predators from having many
            prey. Nevertheless, with the exception of these generalist
            species, MaxEnt adequately predicts that most species have
            low generality and vulnerability values.</p>

            for each species in all (a) empirical and (b) predicted
            joint degree sequences. The predicted joint degree sequences
            were obtained after sampling one realization of the joint

            while keeping the total number of interactions constant. (c)
            Difference between predicted and empirical values when
            species are ordered according to their total degree. Due to
            significant data overlap, all relationships are represented
            as 2D histograms. The color bar indicates the number of
            species that fall within each bin.</p>
            <p>Examining the difference between predicted and empirical
            values for each species gives a slightly different
            perspective (right panel of fig. 2). To make that
            comparison, we must first associate each of our predictions
            with a specific species in a network. Indeed, our predicted
            joint degree sequences have the same number of species
            (elements) as their empirical counterparts, but they are
            species agnostic. In other words, instead of predicting a
            pair of values for each species directly (i.e. the number of
            prey and predators of a given species <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>), we predicted the
            entire joint degree sequence without taking into account
            species’ identity (i.e. the distribution of the number of
            prey and predators for the entire set of species, without
            knowing which values belong to which species). The challenge
            is thus to adequately associate predictions with empirical
            data. In fig. 2, we present these differences when species
            are ordered by their total degree in their respective
            networks (i.e. by the sum of their in and out-degrees). This
            means that the species with the highest total degree in its
            network will be associated with the highest prediction, and
            so forth. Doing so, we see that species predicted to have a
            higher number of predators than what is observed generally
            have a lower number of prey than what is observed (and
            conversely). This is also shown in S1 Fig, which represents
            the relationship between prediction errors in the
            <em>absolute</em> (non-relative) values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            across networks of varying levels of species richness. This
            is because the difference in total degree (<span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> + <em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>)
            between predictions and empirical data is minimized when
            species are ranked by their total degree (i.e. the average
            deviation of the sum of relative <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            is close to <span class="math inline">0</span> across all
            species). This result thus shows that the difference between
            predicted and empirical total degrees is low for most
            species when ordered by their total degrees. There are no
            apparent biases towards in or out degrees. In S2 Fig, we
            show how these differences change when species are instead
            ordered by their out-degrees (left panel) and in-degrees
            (right panel), i.e. when minimizing the error in the
            estimation of the out and in-degrees, respectively.</p>
            <p>Another way to evaluate the empirical support of the
            sampled joint degree sequences is to compare their shape
            with the ones of empirical food webs. We described the shape
            of a joint degree sequence by measuring the distance between
            its in and out-degree sequences (i.e. the distance between
            its marginal distributions). To do so, we calculated the
            Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Kullback1951InfSuf">Kullback &amp; Leibler
            (1951)</span>) between the in and out-degree sequences of
            each predicted and empirical distribution. The KL divergence
            is a measure of relative entropy describing the difference
            between two distributions. Low values indicate high
            similarity between the in and out-degree sequences and
            suggest that the joint degree sequence has a high level of
            symmetry. We compared the shape of the empirical and
            predicted joint degree sequences in the left panel of
            fig. 3. As expected, our model predicts more similar
            in-degree and out-degree sequences than empirical data
            (shown by lower KL divergence values). However, the
            difference between the KL divergence of predicted and
            empirical joint degree sequences decreases with connectance
            (right panel of fig. 3). This might be because food webs
            with a low connectance are harder to predict than food webs
            with a high connectance. Indeed, in low connectance systems,
            what makes two species interact may be more important for
            prediction than in high connectance systems, in which what
            prevents species from interacting may be more meaningful.
            This implies that more ecological information may be needed
            in food webs with a low connectance because more ecological
            processes determine interactions compared to
            non-interactions. Therefore, other ecological constraints
            might be needed to account for the asymmetry of the joint
            degree distribution, especially for networks with a lower
            connectance. Nevertheless, our MaxEnt model seems to capture
            quite well the shape of the joint degree sequence for
            networks having a high connectance.</p>

            realization of the joint degree distribution of maximum
            entropy for each network while keeping the total number of
            interactions constant.</p>
            <p>Regarding the degree distribution of maximum entropy, one
            aspect that informs us of its ecological realism is the
            number of isolated species it predicts. As <span
            class="citation" data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">MacDonald
            <em>et al.</em> (2020)</span> pointed out, the size of food
            webs should at least be of <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span> interactions,
            since a lower number would yield isolated species,
            i.e. species without any predator or prey. Because non-basal
            species must eat to survive, isolated species could indicate
            that other species are missing; otherwise, isolated species
            should be removed from the network. In S3 Fig, we show that
            the degree distribution of maximum entropy, given <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>, gives a very low
            probability that a species will be isolated in its food web
            (i.e. having <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em> = 0</span>) when <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em> &gt; <em>S</em> − 1</span>.
            However, under our purely information-theoretic model, the
            probability that a species is isolated is quite high when
            the total number of interactions is below <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span>. Moreover, the
            expected proportion of isolated species rapidly declines by
            orders of magnitude with increasing numbers of species and
            interactions. This supports the ecological realism of the
            degree distribution of maximum entropy derived above.
            Nevertheless, ecologists wanting to model a system without
            allowing isolated species could simply change the lower
            limit of <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> to
            <span class="math inline">1</span> in eq. 15 and solve the
            resulting equation numerically.</p>
            <h2 id="heuristic-maximum-entropy-models-1">Heuristic
            maximum entropy models</h2>
            <p>In this section, we explore the predictions of our
            heuristic models. Overall, we found that the models based on
            the joint degree sequence (i.e. the type II null and
            heuristic MaxEnt models) reproduced the structure of
            empirical food webs much better than the ones based on
            connectance (i.e. the type I null and heuristic MaxEnt
            models, tbl. 1). This suggests that the predictive capacity
            of connectance might be more limited than what was
            previously suggested (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2014WheEcoa">Poisot &amp; Gravel
            (2014)</span>). On the other hand, the neutral model of
            relative abundances was surprisingly good at predicting the
            maximum trophic level and the network diameter (tbl. 2).
            However, with the exception of the network diameter, the
            type II heuristic MaxEnt model was better at predicting
            network structure than the neutral model for most measures
            considered. This might be because, although neutral
            processes are important, they act in concert with niche
            processes in determining species interactions (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="Bartomeus2016ComFra">Bartomeus
            <em>et al.</em> (2016)</span>, <span class="citation"

            data-cites="Pomeranz2019InfPrea">Pomeranz <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span>). The joint degree sequence captures
            information on both neutral and niche processes because the
            number of prey and predators a species has is determined by
            its relative abundance and biological traits. These results
            thus show that having information on the number of prey and
            predators for each species substantially improves the
            prediction of food-web structure, both compared to models
            solely based on connectance and to the ones solely based on
            species relative abundances.</p>

            <p>Next, the predictions of the type II heuristic MaxEnt
            model can be compared to its null model counterpart. On
            average, the type II heuristic MaxEnt model was better at
            predicting nestedness (<span
            class="math inline">0.62 ± 0.08</span>) than its
            corresponding null model (<span
            class="math inline">0.73 ± 0.05</span>; empirical networks:
            <span class="math inline">0.63 ± 0.09</span>) for networks
            in our complete dataset (tbl. 1). This might in part be due
            to the fact that nestedness was calculated using the
            spectral radius of the adjacency matrix, which directly
            leverages information on the network itself just like the
            heuristic MaxEnt model. The proportion of self-loops
            (cannibal species) was also better predicted by the type II
            heuristic MaxEnt model in comparison to the type II null
            model. However, the type II null model was better at
            predicting network diameter and average maximum similarity
            between species pairs, and predictions of the maximum
            trophic level and the proportion of omnivorous species were
            similar between both types of models. We believe that this
            is because increasing the complexity of a food web might
            increase its average and maximum food-chain lengths. In
            comparison, the null model was more stochastic and does not
            necessarily produce more complex food webs with longer
            food-chain lengths.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we found that the entropy of empirical food
            webs was slightly lower than their maximum entropy when
            constrained by their joint degree sequence (S4 Fig).
            Empirical food webs had an SVD entropy of <span
            class="math inline">0.89 ± 0.04</span>, compared to an SVD
            entropy of <span class="math inline">0.94 ± 0.03</span> for
            networks generated using the type II heuristic MaxEnt model.
            The relationship between the SVD entropy of empirical food
            webs and their maximum entropy is plotted in the last panel
            of fig. 4. The slight increase in entropy confirms that our
            method generated more complex networks. Even though we found
            that many measures of empirical networks are close to the
            ones of their maximum entropy configuration, the relatively
            low predictability of entropy itself may be indicative of
            additional constraints shaping food-web structure,
            especially for networks with low SVD entropy. Incorporating
            more constraints into the model could increase its capacity
            to generate networks with an adequate level of complexity,
            as shown by the decrease in predictive errors of entropy of
            the type II heuristic MaxEnt model compared to the one based
            on connectance (tbl. 1). Additionally, we found no clear
            relationship between the increase in SVD entropy and the
            number of species, the number of interactions, and
            connectance (S5 Fig). This suggests that our model captured
            the complexity of small and large networks on a similar
            level and that its capacity to reproduce food-web structure
            was unrelated to the order and size of the network. In other
            words, the gap in entropy between empirical food webs and
            their maximum entropy configuration may be the result of
            additional constraints that were not taken into account in
            the model, regardless of the number of species and the
            number of interactions.</p>

            empirical and maximum entropy food webs.</strong> Maximum
            entropy networks were obtained using the type II heuristic
            MaxEnt model based on the joint degree sequence. (a)
            Nestedness (estimated using the spectral radius of the
            adjacency matrix), (b) the maximum trophic level, (c) the
            network diameter, and (d) the SVD entropy were measured on
            these empirical and maximum entropy food webs. The identity
            line is plotted in each panel.</p>
            <p>A direct comparison of the structure of maximum entropy
            food webs constrained by the joint degree sequence with
            empirical data also supports the results depicted in tbl. 1.
            In fig. 4, we show how well empirical measures are predicted
            by the type II heuristic MaxEnt model. Following our
            previous results, we found that nestedness was very well
            predicted by our model. However, the model overestimated the
            maximum trophic level and network diameter, especially when
            the sampled food web had intermediate values of these
            measures. In S6 Fig, we show that the pairwise relationships
            between the four measures in fig. 4 and species richness in
            empirical food webs are similar (in magnitude and sign) to
            the ones found in food webs generated using the type II
            heuristic MaxEnt model. This indicates that the number of
            species in the network does not seem to impact the ability
            of the model to reproduce food-web structure.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding its difficulties in reproducing adequate
            measures of food-chain lengths, the type II heuristic MaxEnt
            model can predict surprisingly well the proportions of
            three-species motifs in empirical food webs. Motifs have
            been shown to be the backbone of complex ecological networks
            on which network structure is built and play a crucial role
            in community dynamics and assembly (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Stouffer2011ComInc">Stouffer &amp; Bascompte
            (2011)</span>). Differences in motif profiles between an
            observed food web and null model-generated ones can unveil
            important ecological mechanisms that contribute to network
            structure (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Stouffer2007EviExi">Stouffer <em>et al.</em>
            (2007)</span>). In fig. 5, we show that the motif profile of
            networks generated using the type II heuristic MaxEnt model
            accurately reproduced the one of empirical data. This model
            made significantly better predictions than the ones based on
            connectance and the type II null model based on the joint
            degree sequence. This is also shown in fig. 6, which reveals
            that the relationships between the proportions of
            single-link motifs in empirical food webs are similar to the
            ones in networks generated using the type II heuristic
            MaxEnt model. This is in contrast with the type I null and
            MaxEnt models based on connectance, which produced opposite
            relationships than what was observed empirically. Our
            findings show that generating the most complex food web
            constrained by the joint degree sequence using maximum
            entropy does not alter the proportions of three-species
            motifs on the whole. This suggests that motif profiles may
            simply be a statistical attribute of food webs driven by the
            joint degree sequence. However, given the incapacity of our
            MaxEnt models to accurately predict food-chain lengths, the
            way motifs interconnect with each other may hold greater
            biological significance than the proportion of motifs
            itself.</p>

            <p>One of the challenges in implementing and validating a
            maximum entropy model is to discover where its predictions
            break down. The results depicted in tbl. 1 and fig. 4 show
            that our type II heuristic MaxEnt model can capture many
            high-level properties of food webs, but does a poor job of
            capturing others. This suggests that, although the joint
            degree sequence is an important driver of food-web
            structure, other ecological constraints might be needed to
            account for some emerging food-web properties, especially
            the ones regarding food-chain lengths. Nevertheless, fig. 5
            and fig. 6 show that this model can reproduce surprisingly
            well motif profiles, one of the most ecologically
            informative properties of food webs. This suggests that the
            emerging structure of food webs is mainly driven by their
            joint degree sequence, although higher-level properties
            might need to be included in the model to ensure that
            food-chain lengths fall within realistic values.</p>
            <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>The principle of maximum entropy is a mathematical method
            of finding least-biased probability distributions that have
            some specified properties given by prior knowledge about a
            system. We first applied this conventional MaxEnt approach
            on food webs to predict species-level properties, namely the
            joint degree distribution and the degree distribution of
            maximum entropy given known numbers of species and
            interactions. We found that the joint degree distributions
            of maximum entropy had a similar shape to the ones of
            empirical food webs in high-connectance systems. However,
            these MaxEnt distributions were more symmetric than the ones
            of empirical food webs when connectance was low, which
            suggests that other constraints might be needed to improve
            these predictions in low-connectance systems. Then, we used
            a slightly different approach that aimed at finding
            heuristically the network configuration with the highest SVD
            entropy, i.e. whose vector of relative singular values has
            maximum entropy. This network of maximum entropy is the most
            complex, or random, given the specified structure. We found
            that the heuristic maximum entropy model based on
            connectance did not predict the structure of sampled food
            webs very well. However, the heuristic maximum entropy model
            based on the entire joint degree sequence, i.e. on the
            number of prey and predators for each species, gave more
            convincing results. Indeed, this model reproduced food-web
            structure surprisingly well, including the highly
            informative motif profile. Nevertheless, it was not able to
            predict realistic food-chain lengths.</p>
            <p>Our results bring to the forefront the role of the joint
            degree distribution in shaping food-web structure. This
            echoes the work of <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fortuna2010NesMod">Fortuna <em>et al.</em>
            (2010)</span>, who found that the degree distribution of
            ecological networks drives their emerging structure such as
            their nestedness and modularity. Several measures of food
            webs have been analyzed when studying the ecological
            consequences of network structure (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="McCann2011FooWeb">McCann (2011)</span>, <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Delmas2019AnaEco">Delmas <em>et
            al.</em> (2019)</span>). In fact, following <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">Williams
            (2011)</span>, we believe that there is a lot more
            ecological information in the deviation between these
            properties in empirical systems and their maximum entropy
            configuration given a fixed joint degree sequence.</p>
            <h2 id="alternative-maxent-models">Alternative MaxEnt
            models</h2>
            <p>In this contribution, we used a method based on simulated
            annealing to find the network configuration with the highest
            SVD entropy while fixing some aspects of its structure.
            However, there are different ways to generate adjacency
            matrices using MaxEnt. Another technique, also based on
            simulated annealing, could begin by generating a food web
            randomly with fixed numbers of species and interactions and
            calculating its joint degree distribution. Pairs of
            interactions could then be swapped sequentially until we
            minimize the divergence between the calculated joint degree
            distribution and the one of maximum entropy obtained
            analytically. In that case, this is the entropy of the joint
            degree distribution that would be maximized, not the one of
            the network’s topology. To a certain extent, this method
            would bridge the gap between the analytical and heuristic
            approaches presented in this article. More research is
            needed to compare the quality of different methods in
            generating adjacency matrices of food webs using MaxEnt.</p>
            <p>Maximum entropy graph models are another type of method
            that predicts a distribution of adjacency matrices under
            soft or hard constraints (e.g. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Park2004StaMeca">Park &amp; Newman
            (2004)</span>, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Cimini2019StaPhy">Cimini <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span>). Under hard constraints, every network with a
            non-zero probability exactly satisfies the constraints on
            its structure. This is in contrast with soft constraints,
            which require that networks satisfy them on average
            (i.e. many networks with a non-zero probability do not have
            the exact structure set by the constraints). Maximum entropy
            graph models are helpful because they can provide
            probability distributions for many network properties by
            measuring the structure of all adjacency matrices with a
            non-zero probability. However, we consider that our approach
            based on simulated annealing is more flexible and more
            computationally efficient. Indeed, many measures of food-web
            structure are hard to translate into mathematical
            constraints. Moreover, because food webs are directed
            networks that can have self-loops, it makes the mathematical
            derivation of maximum entropy graph models difficult. We
            believe that identifying heuristically what constrains the
            topology of food webs is a useful first step before
            attempting to derive the mathematical formulation of a
            maximum entropy graph model for food webs.</p>
            <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
            <p>Our analytical and heuristic models can be applied for
            different purposes. First, they could be used to generate
            first-order approximations of a network’s properties when
            state variables are known empirically. For example, knowing
            the number of species in an ecological community, we can
            predict its number of interactions using the flexible links
            model and then predict its joint degree distribution with
            minimal biases using the principle of maximum entropy. This
            could prove particularly useful when predicting network
            structure at large spatial scales, subdividing the study
            area into smaller communities (e.g. grid cells). Indeed,
            because species richness and other ecological data are
            increasingly abundant (e.g. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dickinson2010CitSci">Dickinson <em>et al.</em>
            (2010)</span>), validated MaxEnt models can be used to
            respond to a wider range of macroecological questions
            regarding food webs.</p>
            <p>Second, our analytical model can be used to generate
            informative priors in Bayesian analyses of the structure of
            ecological networks (e.g. <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Cirtwill2019QuaFrac">Cirtwill <em>et al.</em>
            (2019)</span>). Indeed, the probability distribution of
            maximum entropy derived using MaxEnt can be used as a prior
            that can be updated with novel data. For instance, if we
            know the number of species and the number of interactions,
            we can derive the degree distribution of maximum entropy, as
            shown in this contribution. The degree distribution
            represents the probability that a species can interact (as a
            predator or a prey) with a given number of other species.
            Data on species interactions can be used to update the prior
            degree distribution to generate a more accurate posterior
            distribution, thus improving our description and
            understanding of the system.</p>
            <p>Third, our analytical and heuristic models can be used to
            make better predictions of pairwise species interactions by
            constraining the space of feasible networks, as discussed in
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021a)</span>. In other words, we can use the network
            configuration or specific measures of food-web structure
            derived using MaxEnt to ensure that our predictions of
            interspecific interactions form feasible networks. This
            means that the probability that two species interact may be
            conditional on the network structure and the probability of
            interactions of all other species pairs. When data are
            limited, MaxEnt can be used to predict network structure on
            which pairwise probabilities of interactions are
            conditional.</p>
            <p>Finally, our analytical and heuristic models can be used
            as alternative null models of ecological networks to better
            understand and identify the ecological processes driving
            food-web structure. Indeed, these mechanisms can be better
            described when analyzing the deviation of empirical data
            from MaxEnt predictions (<span class="citation"
            data-cites="Caruso2022FluEco">Caruso <em>et al.</em>
            (2022)</span>). A strong deviation would indicate that
            ecological mechanisms not captured by the statistical
            constraints are at play for the system at hand. For
            instance, the incapacity of a MaxEnt model to reliably
            predict entropy may be a compelling indication of additional
            constraints shaping food-web structure. If deviations are
            systematic, the maximum entropy model might need to be
            revised to include appropriate ecological constraints. This
            revision process helps us reflect on and identify what
            constrains food-web structure. However, it is important to
            note that tangible ecological mechanisms cannot be directly
            inferred from statistical distributions (<span
            class="citation" data-cites="WarrenII2022SeeSha">Warren II
            <em>et al.</em> (2022)</span>). Instead, by identifying the
            constraints of a system and by analyzing empirical
            deviations from maximum entropy predictions, MaxEnt can only
            help us redirect research efforts toward understanding the
            biological mechanisms behind these constraints.</p>
            <p>The principle of maximum entropy can thus be applied to
            both the prediction and understanding of natural systems.
            The model’s interpretation depends on how we use it. It can
            be used as a baseline distribution to identify the
            ecological processes organizing natural systems. It can also
            be used to generate predictions of ecological networks. This
            distinction between understanding and predicting is
            important when using and interpreting MaxEnt models.</p>
            <h2 id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges in using the principle of
            maximum entropy is to identify the set of state variables
            that best reproduce empirical data. We found that the number
            of species and the number of interactions are important
            state variables for the prediction of the joint degree
            distribution. Similarly, we found that the numbers of prey
            and predators for each species in a food web are important
            state variables for the prediction of the network
            configuration. However, our predictions overestimated the
            symmetry of the joint degree distribution for our analytical
            model and the maximum trophic level and network diameter for
            our heuristic model. We should thus continue to play the
            ecological detective to find these other topological
            constraints that would improve the predictions of MaxEnt
            models and help us understand better what drives food-web
            structure.</p>

            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>.</strong>
            Species were ordered according to their total degree in
            their network. Networks were sorted into different groups
            based on their total number of species. In each panel, each
            dot corresponds to a single species within one of the
            networks whose total species count is within the specified
            range. The predicted joint degree sequences were obtained
            after sampling one realization of the joint degree
            distribution of maximum entropy for each network while
            keeping the total number of interactions constant.</p>
            <p><strong>S2 Fig. Prediction errors of the relative number
            of predators <span

            and prey <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>.</strong>
            Species were ordered according to (a) their out-degree and
            (b) their in-degree. The predicted joint degree sequences
            were obtained after sampling one realization of the joint
            degree distribution of maximum entropy for each network
            while keeping the total number of interactions constant. Due
            to significant data overlap, all relationships are
            represented as 2D histograms. The color bar indicates the
            number of species that fall within each bin.</p>
            <p><strong>S3 Fig. Probability that a species is isolated in
            its food web.</strong> We derived many degree distributions
            of maximum entropy given a range of values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> and plotted the
            probability that a species has a degree <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> of <span
            class="math inline">0</span> (log-scale color bar). Species
            richness varies between <span class="math inline">5</span>
            and <span class="math inline">100</span> species, by
            increment of <span class="math inline">5</span> species. For
            each level of species richness, the numbers of interactions
            correspond to all 20-quantiles of the interval between <span
            class="math inline">0</span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em><sup>2</sup></span>. The black
            line marks the <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span> minimum number of
            interactions required to have no isolated species.</p>
            <p><strong>S4 Fig. SVD entropy of empirical and predicted
            food webs.</strong> (a) Distribution of the SVD entropy of
            empirical and maximum entropy food webs. Maximum entropy
            networks were obtained using the type II heuristic MaxEnt
            model based on the joint degree sequence. (b) Distribution
            of z-scores of the SVD entropy of all empirical food webs.
            Z-scores were computed using the mean and standard deviation
            of the distribution of SVD entropy of MaxEnt food webs (type
            II heuristic MaxEnt model). The dashed line corresponds to
            the median z-score.</p>
            <p><strong>S5 Fig. Prediction errors of SVD
            entropy.</strong> Difference in SVD entropy between maximum
            entropy and empirical food webs as a function of (a) the
            number of interactions, (b) connectance, and (c) species
            richness. (d) Standardization of the difference in SVD
            entropy with respect to species richness as a function of
            species richness. The exponential decrease in the difference
            of SVD entropy per species with species richness offers a
            complementary perspective supporting the lack of
            relationship depicted in panel c. Maximum entropy networks
            were obtained using the type II heuristic MaxEnt model based
            on the joint degree sequence.</p>
            <p><strong>S6 Fig. Structure of empirical and maximum
            entropy food webs as a function of species
            richness.</strong> Maximum entropy networks were obtained
            using the type II heuristic MaxEnt model based on the joint
            degree sequence. (a) Nestedness (estimated using the
            spectral radius of the adjacency matrix), (b) the maximum
            trophic level, (c) the network diameter, and (d) the SVD
            entropy were measured on these empirical and maximum entropy
            food webs and plotted against species richness. Regression
            lines are plotted in each panel.</p>
