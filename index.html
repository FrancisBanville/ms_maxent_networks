            Food webs are complex ecological networks whose structure is
            both ecologically and statistically constrained, with many
            network properties being correlated with each other. Despite
            the recognition of these invariable relationships in food
            webs, the use of the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt)
            in network ecology is still rare. This is surprising
            considering that MaxEnt is a statistical tool precisely
            designed for understanding and predicting many different
            types of constrained systems. Precisely, this principle
            asserts that the least-biased probability distribution of a
            system’s property, constrained by prior knowledge about that
            system, is the one with maximum information entropy. MaxEnt
            has been proven useful in many ecological modelling
            problems, but its application in food webs and other
            ecological networks is limited. Here we show how MaxEnt can
            be used to derive many food-web properties both analytically
            and heuristically. First, we show how the joint degree
            distribution (the joint probability distribution of the
            numbers of prey and predators for each species in the
            network) can be derived analytically using the number of
            species and the number of interactions in food webs. Second,
            we present a heuristic and flexible approach of finding a
            network’s adjacency matrix (the network’s representation in
            matrix format) based on simulated annealing and SVD entropy.
            We built two heuristic models using the connectance and the
            joint degree sequence as statistical constraints,
            respectively. We compared both models’ predictions against
            corresponding null and neutral models commonly used in
            network ecology using open access data of terrestrial and
            aquatic food webs sampled globally (N = 257). We found that
            the heuristic model constrained by the joint degree sequence
            was a good predictor of many measures of food-web structure,
            especially the nestedness and motifs distribution.
            Specifically, our results suggest that the structure of
            terrestrial and aquatic food webs is mainly driven by their
            joint degree distribution.

            <p>A variety of measures of the structure of ecological
            networks have been used to describe the organization of
            species interactions in a biological community <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Delmas2019AnaEco">(Delmas
            <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span>. These measures provide
            valuable information on the functioning of ecosystems and
            their responses to environmental change <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Pascual2006EcoNeta Gomez2011FunConb">(e.g.,
            Pascual &amp; Dunne 2006; Gómez <em>et al.</em>
            2011)</span>. For instance, <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Bascompte2003NesAssa">Bascompte <em>et al.</em>
            (2003)</span> suggest that plant–pollinator and
            seed-disperser networks have a highly nested structure that
            can promote species persistence. Another example, in food
            webs, shows that a high connectance can promote the
            robustness of the system to species lost <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Dunne2002NetStrb">(Dunne <em>et
            al.</em> 2002)</span>. However, despite the growing
            literature on the ecological implications of network
            structure, the association between many of these measures
            impedes our ability to fully understand what drives the
            structure and behavior of ecological networks. In
            particular, nestedness and modularity are strongly
            associated in ecological networks <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fortuna2010NesMod">(Fortuna <em>et al.</em>
            2010)</span>, and network connectance has been shown to be
            an important driver of many other emerging network
            properties <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2014WheEcoa">(Poisot &amp; Gravel
            2014)</span>. In light of these observations, it is
            difficult to assess whether attributed effects of given
            properties are the artifacts of other, perhaps simpler,
            measures.</p>
            <p>One way to tackle this issue is first to recognize that
            food webs and other ecological networks are constrained
            systems. In other words, the space of possible network
            configurations shrinks as we know more about a network
            structure. For example, there is a finite number of networks
            with specified numbers of nodes and edges. Indeed, the
            structure of ecological networks is first and above all
            constrained by the number of species, or nodes, present.
            Food webs with high species richness typically have a lower
            connectance <span class="citation"
            data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">(MacDonald <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span> than smaller networks. This is because the
            number of realized interactions in empirical food webs
            scales slower than the number of possible species pairs
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">(MacDonald <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span>. As shown by <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2014WheEcoa">Poisot &amp; Gravel
            (2014)</span>, connectance itself can constrain different
            aspects of network structure such as the degree distribution
            (i.e. the probability distribution of the number of
            interspecific interactions realized by a species). Other
            measures, such as the maximum trophic level, can also
            constrain the space of feasible networks.</p>
            <p>Prior knowledge on the structure of ecological networks
            is thus especially useful in the current context of data
            scarcity about species interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Jordano2016SamNeta">(Jordano 2016)</span>.
            Indeed, this Eltonian shortfall <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Hortal2015SevSho">(Hortal <em>et al.</em>
            2015)</span> can be partially alleviated using known
            information about an ecological network. As suggested by
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021a)</span>, network structure can be used to improve the
            prediction of pairwise species interactions when data is
            lacking by constraining the space of feasible networks.
            Similarly, partial knowledge on the structure of an
            ecological network can also be used to predict others of its
            properties by constraining their range of possible values.
            This is important given that many aspects of network
            structure cannot be measured empirically without data on
            pairwise species interactions, a prevailing situation
            worldwide <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2021GloKno">(Poisot <em>et al.</em>
            2021)</span>.</p>
            <p>Understanding the ecological constraints that shape
            species interactions networks and predicting their emerging
            structure are thus two complementary aims of network
            ecology. This distinction between understanding and
            predicting is essential when using statistical and
            mathematical models in network ecology and interpreting
            them. On one hand, null models help us identify potential
            ecological mechanisms that drive species interactions and
            constrain ecological networks. Null models generate a
            distribution for a target measure using a set of rules that
            exclude the mechanism of interest <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fortuna2006HabLos Delmas2019AnaEco">(Fortuna
            &amp; Bascompte 2006; Delmas <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span>.
            The deviation between the model and empirical data helps us
            evaluate the effect of this ecological process in nature. On
            the other hand, predictive models can help fill many gaps on
            species interactions data. A variety of such models have
            recently been developed using machine learning and other
            statistical tools, most of which are presented in <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom
            <em>et al.</em> (2021a)</span>. However, given the
            constrained nature of ecological networks, it is surprising
            that the principle of maximum entropy, a mathematical method
            designed for both the analysis and prediction of constrained
            systems, has been barely used in network ecology.</p>

            theory <span class="citation"

            a set of constraints given by prior knowledge of a system
            (i.e. what we call state variables), this method helps us
            find least-biased probability distributions subject to the
            constraints. These probability distributions are guaranteed
            to be unique given our prior knowledge and represent the
            most we can say about a system without making more
            assumptions. For example, if the only thing we know about a
            biological community is its average number of individuals
            per species, the least-biased inference we could make on its
            species abundance distribution is the exponential
            distribution <span class="citation"

            Smith 2011; Harte &amp; Newman 2014)</span>. However, this
            does not imply that this distribution will be the best fit
            to empirical data. The challenge is to find the right set of
            constraints that would best reproduce distributions found in
            nature.</p>
            <p>MaxEnt states that the least-biased probability
            distribution given the constraints used is the one with the
            highest entropy among all probability distributions that
            satisfy these constraints. Entropy is a measure of the
            average amount of information given by the outcome of a
            random variable. Many measures of entropy have been
            developed in physics <span class="citation"

            constraints could include one or many properties of the
            probability distribution (e.g., its mean, variance, and
            range). However, the normalization constraint always need to

            has never been used to predict food-web structure directly,
            even though food webs are among the most documented and
            widespread ecological networks <span class="citation"

            <p>Food-web properties that can be derived using MaxEnt are
            varied and pertain to different elements of the network
            (i.e. at the species (node), the interaction (edge) or the
            community (network) levels). Because MaxEnt is a method of
            finding least-biased probability distributions given partial
            knowledge about a system, these properties need to be
            represented probabilistically. For example, at the species
            level, MaxEnt can be used to predict the distribution of
            trophic levels among species, as well as the distribution of
            species’ vulnerability (number of predators) and generality
            (number of prey). By contrast, at the interaction level,
            predictions can be made on the distribution of interaction
            strengths in weighted food webs. At the community level, it
            can generate probability distributions of many measures of
            their emerging structure and of networks themselves (i.e. a
            probability distribution that specific network
            configurations are realized given the model and
            constraints). Overall, the potential of this method in the
            study of food webs is broad. The applicability and
            performance of MaxEnt mostly depend on the ecological
            information available and on our capacity to find the right
            set of state variables that best represent natural systems
            and to translate them into appropriate statistical
            constraints. Having a validated maximum entropy model for
            the system at hand allows us to make least-biased
            predictions using a minimal amount of data, as well as
            identify the most important ecological processes shaping
            that system. In other words, MaxEnt can help us better
            understand and predict the structure of ecological networks
            worldwide.</p>
            <h2 id="analytical-and-heuristic-approaches">Analytical and
            heuristic approaches</h2>
            <p>In this contribution, we used two complementary
            approaches to predict the structure of food webs using the
            principle of maximum entropy. The first approach consists in
            deriving constrained probability distributions of given
            network properties analytically, whereas the second approach
            consists in finding the adjacency matrix of maximum entropy
            heuristically, from which network properties can be
            measured. We compared our predictions against empirical data
            and null and neutral models commonly used in network
            ecology. We focus on deterministic and unweighted (Boolean)
            food webs in both approaches for data availability reasons.
            However, our framework can be applied to all types of
            ecological networks and a wide variety of measures.</p>
            <p>For the first approach (analytic), we focus on species
            level properties. Specifically, we derived the joint degree
            distribution (i.e. the joint probability distribution that a
            species has a given number of prey and predators in its
            network) of maximum entropy using only the number of species
            <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> and the number
            of interactions <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>
            as state variables. Then, we predicted the degree
            distribution of maximum entropy directly from the joint
            degree distribution since the first is the sum of the
            marginal distributions of the second. Because of the
            scarcity of empirical data on the number of interactions in
            food webs, we present a method to predict <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> from <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> (Box 1), thus allowing
            the prediction of the joint degree distribution from <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> solely.</p>
            <p>For the second approach (heuristic), we focus on network
            level properties. We used a flexible and heuristic model
            based on simulated annealing (an optimization algorithm) to
            find the network configuration <em>close</em> to maximum
            entropy and measured its structure. We developed this
            heuristic model because the analytical derivation of a
            maximum entropy graph model of food webs is difficult, and
            because this model is readily applicable to other types of
            ecological networks and measures. Indeed, the mathematical
            representation of food webs (i.e. directed simple graphs
            frequently having self-loops) makes the optimization of
            maximum entropy graph models more complicated than with many
            other types of (non-ecological) networks. In other words,
            deriving a probability distribution on the graphs themselves
            is difficult when working with food webs. We built two types
            of heuristic MaxEnt models depending on the constraint used.
            Our type I MaxEnt model uses the connectance of the network
            (i.e. the ratio <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em>/<em>S</em><sup>2</sup></span>)
            as a constraint, whereas our type II MaxEnt model uses the
            whole joint degree sequence as a constraint.</p>
            <h1 id="analytical-maximum-entropy-models">Analytical
            maximum entropy models</h1>
            <p>Our analytical approach is the most common way to use and
            develop maximum entropy models. As shown above, starting
            from a defined set of constraints, a mathematical expression
            for the target distribution is derived using the method of
            Lagrange multipliers. The derived distribution of maximum
            entropy is unique and least biased given the constraints
            used. Although we refer to this approach as analytic,
            finding the values of the Lagrange multipliers usually
            requires the use of numerical methods. Here we use MaxEnt to
            derive two species level properties in food webs: the joint
            degree distribution and the degree distribution. The degree
            distribution has driven the attention of ecologists because
            of its role in determining the assembly of ecological
            networks <span class="citation"

            data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">(Williams 2011)</span>, we
            show in much greater details its mathematical derivation in
            food webs. But first, we derive the joint degree
            distribution, a related property that holds significantly
            more ecological information than the degree
            distribution.</p>
            <p>We tested our analytical MaxEnt model against open
            food-web data queried from three different sources and
            integrated into what we call our <em>complete dataset</em>.
            These sources include (1) terrestrial and aquatic food webs
            sampled globally and archived on the ecological interactions
            database Mangal; (2) freshwater stream food webs from New
            Zealand; and (3) aquatic food webs from Tuesday Lake

            ecological networks archived on Mangal are multilayer
            networks, i.e. networks that describe different types of
            interactions. We kept all networks whose interactions were
            mainly of predation and herbivory types, and removed the
            largest network (<span

            computational efficiency reasons. Then, to this set we added

            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            to the linkage density <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em>/<em>S</em></span>. It is
            important to notice that <span
            class="math inline">⟨<em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub>⟩ = ⟨<em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub>⟩</span>
            because every edge is associated to a predator and a prey.
            Therefore, without using any further constraints, we would
            expect the joint degree distribution of maximum entropy to
            be a symmetric probability distribution with regards to
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>.
            However, this does not mean that the joint degree
            <em>sequence</em> will be symmetric, since the joint degree
            sequence is essentially a random realization of its
            probabilistic counterpart.</p>
            <p>The joint probability distribution of maximum entropy
            given these constraints is found using the method of
            Lagrange multipliers. To do so, we seek to maximize the
            following expression:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:F_jdd"><span class="math display">$$F = H -
            \lambda_1(g_1-1)-\lambda_2\left( g_2-\frac{L}{S}\right) -
            \lambda_3 \left(
            g_3-\frac{L}{S}\right),\qquad{(7)}$$</span></span></p>
            <p>where <span
            class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, <span
            class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and <span
            class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>3</sub></span> are the
            Lagrange multipliers. The probability distribution that
            maximizes entropy is obtained by finding these values. As
            pointed out above, <span
            class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is just Shannon’s
            entropy to which we added terms that each sums to zero (our
            constraints). <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is
            maximized by setting to 0 its partial derivative with
            respect to <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub>,<em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub>)</span>.
            Because the derivative of a constant is zero, this gives

            <p>We solved eq. 12 and eq. 13 numerically using the Julia

            substituted in eq. 10 to have a more workable expression for
            the joint degree distribution.</p>
            <p>We assessed the empirical support of this expression
            using all food webs in our complete dataset. First, we
            predicted the joint degree distribution of maximum entropy
            for each of these food webs, i.e. using their number of
            species and number of interactions as state variables. Then,
            we sampled one realization of the joint degree sequence for
            each network using the probabilities given by the joint
            degree distribution of maximum entropy, while fixing the
            total number of interactions. This gave us a random
            realization of the number of prey and predators for each
            species in each network. We standardized the predicted <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            of each species by the total number of species in their
            network to generate relative values, which can be compared
            across networks. In fig. 1 (left panels), we show the
            relationship between these relative <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            obtained from the joint degree distributions of maximum
            entropy (bottom panel) and this relationship using empirical
            values (top panel). We observe that our model predicts
            higher values of generality and vulnerability compared to
            empirical food webs (i.e. relative values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            both closer to <span class="math inline">1</span>) for many
            species. In other words, our model predicts that species
            that have many predators also have more prey than what is
            observed empirically (and conversely). This is not
            surprising, given that our model did not include biological
            factors preventing generalist predators from having many
            prey. Nevertheless, with the exception of these generalist
            species, MaxEnt adequately predicts that most species have
            low generality and vulnerability values.</p>
            <p>Examining the difference between predicted and empirical
            values for each species gives a slightly different
            perspective (right panel of fig. 1). To do so, we must first
            associate each of our predictions to a specific species in a
            network in order to make that comparison. Indeed, our
            predicted joint degree sequences have the same number of
            species (elements) as their empirical counterparts, but they
            are species agnostic. In other words, instead of predicting
            a value for each species directly, we predicted the entire
            joint degree sequence without taking into account species’
            identity. The challenge is thus to adequately associate
            predictions with empirical data. In fig. 1, we present these
            differences when species are ordered by their total degree
            in their respective networks (i.e. by the sum of their in
            and out-degrees). This means that the species with the
            highest total degree in its network will be associated with
            the highest prediction, and so forth. Doing so, we see that
            species predicted to have a higher number of predators than
            what is observed generally have a lower number of prey than
            what is observed (and conversely). This is because the
            difference in total degree (<span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub> + <em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>)
            between predictions and empirical data is minimized when
            species are ranked by their total degree (i.e. the average
            deviation of the sum of relative <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>
            and <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            is close to <span class="math inline">0</span> across all
            species). This result thus shows that the difference between
            predicted and empirical total degrees is low for most
            species when ordered by their total degrees. There are no
            apparent biases towards in or out degrees. In fig. S1, we
            show how these differences change when species are instead
            ordered by their out-degrees (left panel) and in-degrees
            (right panel), respectively.</p>

            <p>Another way to evaluate the empirical support of the
            predicted joint degree sequences is to compare their shape
            with the ones of empirical food webs. We can describe the
            shape of a joint degree sequence by comparing its marginal
            distributions with one another. To do so, we calculated the
            Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the in and
            out-degree sequences sampled from the joint degree
            distribution of maximum entropy. Similarly, we calculated
            the divergence between the in and out-degree sequences
            obtained empirically. This allows us to compare the symmetry
            of empirical and predicted joint degree sequences (left
            panel of fig. 2). As we expected, our model predicts more
            similar in-degree and out-degree sequences than empirical
            data (shown by lower KL divergence values). However, this
            difference decreases with connectance (right panel of
            fig. 2). This might be due to the fact that food webs with a
            low connectance are harder to predict than food webs with a
            high connectance. Indeed, in low connectance systems, what
            makes two species interact might be more important for
            prediction than in high connectance systems, in which what
            prevents species from interacting might be more meaningful.
            This implies that more ecological information might be
            needed in food webs with a low connectance because more
            ecological processes determine interactions compared to
            non-interactions. Therefore, other ecological constraints
            might be needed to account for the asymmetry of the joint
            degree distribution, especially for networks with a lower
            connectance. However, our MaxEnt model was able to capture
            quite well the shape of the joint degree sequence for
            networks having a high connectance.</p>

            <h2 id="degree-distribution">Degree distribution</h2>
            <p>The joint degree distribution derived using MaxEnt
            (eq. 10) can be used to obtain the degree distribution of
            maximum entropy. Indeed, the degree distribution <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>k</em>)</span> represents
            the probability that a species has <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> interactions in its
            food web, with <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em> = <em>k</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> + <em>k</em><sub><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></sub></span>.
            It can thus be obtained from the joint degree distribution
            as follows:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">$$p(k) = \sum_{i=0}^k p(k_{in}
            = k - i, k_{out} = i).$$</span></p>
            <p>The degree distribution could have also been obtained
            directly using the principle of maximum entropy, as
            discussed in <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">Williams (2011)</span>. This
            gives the following distribution:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:lagrange_dd"><span
            class="math display">$$p(k) =
            \frac{e^{-\lambda_2k}}{Z},\qquad{(14)}$$</span></span></p>
            <p>with <span class="math inline">$Z = \sum_{k=0}^S
            e^{-\lambda_2k}.$</span></p>
            <p>This can be solved numerically using the constraint of
            the average degree <span class="math inline">$\langle k
            \rangle = \frac{2L}{S}$</span> of a species, yielding an
            identical solution to the one obtained using the joint
            degree distribution as an intermediate. Note that the mean
            degree is twice the value of the linkage density, because
            every link must be counted twice when we add in and
            out-degrees together.</p>
            <p><span id="eq:lagrange2_dd"><span
            class="math display">$$\frac{1}{Z}\sum_{k=0}^S k
            e^{-\lambda_2k} =
            \frac{2L}{S}\qquad{(15)}$$</span></span></p>
            <p>One aspect of the degree distribution that informs us of
            its ecological realism is the number of isolated species it
            predicts. As <span class="citation"
            data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">MacDonald <em>et al.</em>
            (2020)</span> pointed out, the size of food webs should at
            least be of <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span>
            interactions, since a lower number would yield isolated
            species, i.e. species without any predators or prey. Because
            non-basal species must eat to survive, isolated species
            could indicate that other species are missing or they could
            simply be removed from the food web. In fig. S2, we show
            that the degree distribution of maximum entropy, given <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>, gives very low
            probabilities that a species will be isolated in its food
            web (i.e. having <span
            class="math inline"><em>k</em> = 0</span>) above the <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span> threshold.
            However, under our purely information-theoretic model, the
            probability that a species is isolated is quite high when
            the total number of interactions is below <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span>. Moreover, the
            expected proportion of isolated species rapidly declines by
            orders of magnitude with increasing numbers of species and
            interactions. This supports the ecological realism of the
            degree distribution of maximum entropy derived above.
            Nevertheless, ecologists wanting to model a system without
            allowing isolated species could simply change the lower

            1 - Working with predicted numbers of interactions</h1>
            <p>Our analytical MaxEnt models require information on the
            number of species and the number of interactions. However,
            since the later is rarely measured empirically, ecologists
            might need to use predictive models to estimate the total
            number of interactions in a food web before using MaxEnt.
            Here we illustrate how this can be done by combining both
            models sequentially.</p>
            <p>We used the flexible links model of <span
            class="citation" data-cites="MacDonald2020RevLin">MacDonald
            <em>et al.</em> (2020)</span> to predict the number of
            interactions from the number of species. The flexible links
            model, in contrast to other predictive models of the number
            of interactions, incorporates meaningful ecological
            constraints into the prediction of <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>, namely the minimum
            <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> − 1</span> and maximum
            <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sup>2</sup></span>
            numbers of interactions in food webs. It estimates the
            proportion of the <span
            class="math inline"><em>S</em><sup>2</sup> − (<em>S</em>−1)</span>
            <em>flexible links</em> that are realized. More precisely,
            this model states that the number of <em>realized</em>
            flexible links (or interactions) <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub><em>F</em><em>L</em></sub></span>
            in a food web represents the number of realized interactions

            Therefore, the type I and II topological null models
            correspond to our type I and II heuristic MaxEnt models,
            respectively, since they use similar constraints.</p>
            <p>We generated probabilistic networks using both types of
            null models for all empirical food webs in our complete
            dataset. Then, we converted these networks to adjacency
            matrices of Boolean values by generating <span
            class="math inline">100</span> random networks for each of
            these probabilistic webs, and kept the <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> entries that were
            sampled the most amount of times, with <span
            class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> given by the number of
            interactions in each food web. This ensured that the
            resulting null networks had the same number of interactions
            as their empirical counterparts. Thus, for each null model,

            <h1 id="heuristic-maximum-entropy-models">Heuristic maximum
            entropy models</h1>
            <p>With the analytical approach, we showed how important
            measures of food-web structure (e.g., the degree
            distribution and the joint degree distribution) can be
            derived with the principle of maximum entropy using minimal
            knowledge about a biological community. This type of models,
            although useful to make least-biased predictions of many
            network properties, can be hard to apply for other measures.
            Indeed, there are dozens of measures of network structure
            <span class="citation" data-cites="Delmas2019AnaEco">(Delmas
            <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span> and many are not directly
            calculated with mathematical equations, but are instead
            estimated algorithmically. Moreover, the applicability of
            this method to empirical systems is limited by the state
            variables we can actually measure and use. Here, we propose
            a more flexible method to predict many measures of network
            structure simultaneously, i.e. by finding heuristically the
            network configuration having maximum entropy given partial
            knowledge of its emerging structure.</p>
            <h2 id="from-shannons-to-svd-entropy">From Shannon’s to SVD
            entropy</h2>
            <p>The principle of maximum entropy can be applied on the
            network itself if we decompose its adjacency matrix into a
            non-zero vector of relative values. This is a necessary step
            when working with food webs, which are frequently expressed
            as a matrix <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em> = [<em>a</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub>]</span>
            of Boolean values representing the presence (<span
            class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> = 1</span>)
            or absence (<span
            class="math inline"><em>a</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> = 0</span>)
            of an interaction between two species <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span>. Knowing one or many
            properties of a food web of interest (e.g., its number of
            species and number of interactions), we can simulate its
            adjacency matrix randomly by using these known ecological
            information to constrain the space of potential networks.
            The entropy of this hypothetical matrix can then be measured
            after decomposing it into appropriate values. Simulating a
            series of networks until we find the one having the highest
            entropy allows us to search for the most complex food-web
            configuration given the ecological constraints used. This
            configuration is the least biased one considering the
            information available. In other words, the most we can say
            about a network’s adjacency matrix, without making more
            assumptions than the ones given by our incomplete knowledge
            of its structure, is the one of maximum entropy. Generating
            the most complex network that corresponds to this structure
            allows us to explore more easily other properties of food
            webs under MaxEnt.</p>
            <p>Shannon’s entropy can only be calculated on conventional
            probability distributions such as the joint degree
            distribution. This is an issue when working with the
            adjacency matrix of ecological networks. For this reason, we
            need to use another measure of entropy if we want to predict
            a network’s configuration directly using MaxEnt. We used the
            SVD entropy as our measure of entropy, which is an
            application of Shannon’s entropy to the relative non-zero
            singular values of a truncated singular value decomposition
            [t-SVD; <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021SvdEnt">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021b)</span>] of a food web’s Boolean adjacency matrix. We
            measured SVD entropy as follows:</p>
            <p><span id="eq:svd-entropy"><span class="math display">$$J
            = -\sum_{i=1}^R s_i \log
            s_i,\qquad{(21)}$$</span></span></p>
            <p>where <span
            class="math inline"><em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>
            are the relative singular values of the adjacency matrix
            (<span class="math inline">$s_i = \sigma_i / \sum_{i = 1}^R
            \sigma_i$</span>, where <span
            class="math inline"><em>σ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>
            are the singular values). Note that the distribution of
            relative singular values is analogous to a probability
            distribution, with <span
            class="math inline">0 &lt; <em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> &lt; 1</span>
            and <span
            class="math inline">∑<em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = 1</span>.
            This measure also satisfies all four properties of an
            appropriate entropy measure above-mentioned, while being a
            proper measure of the internal complexity of food webs <span

            heuristically given different constraints for all food webs
            in our complete dataset. We built two types of heuristic
            MaxEnt models that differ on the constraint used. The type I
            heuristic MaxEnt model is based on connectance, whereas the
            type II heuristic MaxEnt model is based on the joint degree
            sequence. These models are thus based on the same
            constraints as the types I <span class="citation"

            webs.</p>
            <p>For each network in our complete dataset, we estimated
            their configuration of maximum entropy given each of these
            constraints. For both types of heuristic MaxEnt models, we

            maintained the total number of interactions (i.e. the sum of
            all elements in the matrix) in the type I MaxEnt model and
            the joint degree sequence (i.e. the rows and columns sums)
            in the type II MaxEnt model. These were our initial
            configurations. Then, we swapped interactions sequentially
            while maintaining the original connectance or joint degree
            sequence. Configurations with a higher SVD entropy than the
            previous one in the chain were always accepted, whereas they
            were accepted with a probability conditional to a decreasing
            temperature and the difference in SVD entropy when lower.
            The final configuration with the highest SVD entropy among
            the four chains constitute the estimated maximum entropy
            configuration of a food web given the constraint used.</p>

            <p>We compared the performance of both heuristic MaxEnt
            models in predicting these measures to the one of the null
            and neutral models (Box 2). We conducted these comparisons
            using two different datasets: (1) our complete dataset
            including most food webs archived on Mangal, as well as all
            food webs in the New Zealand and Tuesday Lake datasets, and
            (2) our <em>abundance dataset</em>, a subset of the complete
            dataset comprising all food webs having data on their
            species’ relative abundances (<span
            class="math inline"><em>N</em> = 19</span>). Indeed, of the
            New Zealand and Tuesday Lake datasets, <span
            class="math inline">19</span> networks had data on species’
            relative abundances that were used in the neutral model to
            better assess the performance of our heuristic models. We
            compared our models’ predictions using these two datasets
            separately to minimize biases and to better represent food
            webs with abundance data
            (tbl. <strong>¿tbl:measures_all?</strong> and
            tbl. <strong>¿tbl:measures_abund?</strong>).</p>
            <p>Overall, we found that the models based on the joint
            degree sequence (i.e. the type II null and heuristic MaxEnt
            models) reproduced the structure of empirical food webs much
            better than the ones based on connectance (i.e. the type I
            null and heuristic MaxEnt models). This suggests that the
            predictive power of connectance might be more limited than
            what was previously suggested <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2014WheEcoa">(Poisot &amp; Gravel
            2014)</span>. On the other hand, the neutral model of
            relative abundances was surprisingly good at predicting the
            maximum trophic level and the network diameter. However,
            with the exception of the network diameter, the type II
            heuristic MaxEnt model was better at predicting network
            structure than the neutral model for most measures
            considered. This might be because, although neutral
            processes are important, they act in concert with niche
            processes in determining species interactions <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Bartomeus2016ComFra Poisot2015SpeWhya Pomeranz2019InfPrea">Canard
            <em>et al.</em> (2014)</span>. The joint degree sequence
            encodes information on both neutral and niche processes
            because the number of prey and predators a species has is
            determined by its relative abundance and biological traits.
            These results thus show that having information on the
            number of prey and predators for each species substantially
            improves the prediction of food-web structure, both compared
            to models solely based on connectance and to the ones solely
            based on species relative abundances.</p>
            <p>Next, the predictions of the type II heuristic MaxEnt
            model can be compared to its null model counterpart. On
            average, the type II heuristic MaxEnt model was better at
            predicting nestedness (<span
            class="math inline">0.62 ± 0.08</span>) than its
            corresponding null model (<span
            class="math inline">0.73 ± 0.05</span>; empirical networks:
            <span class="math inline">0.63 ± 0.09</span>) for networks
            in our complete dataset
            (tbl. <strong>¿tbl:measures_all?</strong>). This might in
            part be due to the fact that nestedness was calculated using
            the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix, which directly
            leverages information on the network itself just like the
            heuristic MaxEnt model. The proportion of self-loops
            (cannibal species) was also better predicted by the type II
            heuristic MaxEnt model in comparison to the type II null
            model. However, the type II null model was better at
            predicting network diameter and average maximum similarity
            between species pairs, and predictions of the maximum
            trophic level and the proportion of omnivorous species were
            similar between both types of models. We believe that this
            is because increasing the complexity of a food web might
            increase its average and maximum food-chain lengths. In
            comparison, the null model was more stochastic and does not
            necessarily produce more complex food webs with longer
            food-chain lengths.</p>

            <p>Despite this increase in maximum trophic level and
            network diameter in MaxEnt food webs, we found that
            empirical food webs are close to their maximum entropy given
            a fixed joint degree sequence (fig. S3). Empirical food webs
            in the complete dataset had an SVD entropy of <span
            class="math inline">0.89 ± 0.04</span>, compared to an SVD
            entropy of <span class="math inline">0.94 ± 0.03</span> for
            networks generated using the type II heuristic MaxEnt model.
            The relationship between the SVD entropy of empirical food
            webs and their maximum entropy is plotted in the last panel
            of fig. 4. As expected, the SVD entropy of maximum entropy
            food webs was higher than that of empirical food webs for
            almost all networks, confirming that our method indeed
            generated more complex networks. Moreover, we found no to a
            weak relationship between the increase in SVD entropy and
            the number of species, the number of interactions, and
            connectance (fig. S4). This suggests that the slight
            increase in entropy between empirical food webs and their
            maximum entropy configuration was sufficient to modify some
            of their properties, regardless of their number of species
            and their number of interactions.</p>
            <p>A direct comparison of the structure of maximum entropy
            food webs, constrained by the joint degree sequence, with
            empirical data also supports the results depicted in
            tbl. <strong>¿tbl:measures_all?</strong>. Indeed, in fig. 4
            we show how well empirical measures are predicted by the
            type II heuristic MaxEnt model. In accordance with our
            previous results, we found that nestedness was very well
            predicted by our model. However, the model overestimated the
            maximum trophic level and network diameter, especially when
            the sampled food web had intermediate values of these
            measures. In fig. S5, we show that the pairwise
            relationships between the four measures in fig. 4 and
            species richness in empirical food webs are similar (in
            magnitude and sign) to the ones found in food webs generated
            using the type II heuristic MaxEnt model. This indicates
            that the number of species in the network does not seem to
            impact the ability of the model to reproduce food-web
            structure.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding its difficulties in reproducing adequate
            measures of food-chain lengths, the type II heuristic MaxEnt
            model can predict surprisingly well the motifs profile.
            Motifs are the backbone of complex ecological networks from
            which network structure is built upon and play a crucial
            role in community dynamics and assembly <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Stouffer2011ComInc">(Stouffer
            &amp; Bascompte 2011)</span>. For this reason, the motifs
            profile can act as an effective ecological constraint
            shaping species interactions networks, and thus constitute a
            substantial source of ecological information. In fig. 5, we
            show that the motifs profile of networks generated using the
            type II heuristic MaxEnt model accurately reproduced the one
            of empirical data. This model made significantly better
            predictions than the ones based on connectance and the type
            II null model based on the joint degree sequence. This is
            also shown in fig. 6, where we see that the relationships
            between motifs proportions in empirical food webs are very
            similar to the ones in networks generated using the type II
            heuristic MaxEnt model. This is in contrast with the type I
            null and MaxEnt models based on connectance, which produced
            opposite relationships than what was observed empirically.
            Our findings thus suggest that increasing food-web
            complexity within a maximum entropy framework based on the
            joint degree sequence does not alter the proportion of
            three-species motifs, but might alter their position
            relative to one another.</p>

            maximum entropy model is to discover where its predictions
            break down. The results depicted in
            tbl. <strong>¿tbl:measures_all?</strong> and fig. 4 show
            that our type II heuristic MaxEnt model can capture many
            high-level properties of food webs, but does a poor job of
            capturing others. This suggests that, although the joint
            degree sequence is an important driver of food-web
            structure, other ecological constraints might be needed to
            account for some emerging food-web properties, especially
            the ones regarding food-chain lengths. Nevertheless, fig. 5
            and fig. 6 show that the model can reproduce surprisingly
            well the motifs profile, one of the most ecologically
            informative properties of food webs. This suggests that the
            emerging structure of food webs is mainly driven by their
            joint degree sequence, although higher-level properties
            might be needed to ensure that food-chain lengths fall
            within realistic values.</p>
            <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>The principle of maximum entropy is a mathematical method
            of finding least-biased probability distributions that have
            some specified properties given by prior knowledge about a
            system. We first applied this conventional MaxEnt approach
            on food webs to predict species level properties, namely the
            joint degree distribution and the degree distribution of
            maximum entropy given known numbers of species and
            interactions. We found that the joint degree distributions
            of maximum entropy had a similar shape to the ones of
            empirical food webs in high-connectance systems. However,
            these MaxEnt distributions were more symmetric than the ones
            of empirical food webs when connectance was low, which
            suggests that other constraints might be needed to improve
            these predictions in low-connectance systems. Then, we used
            a slightly different approach that aimed at finding
            heuristically the network configuration with the highest SVD
            entropy, i.e. whose vector of relative singular values has
            maximum entropy. This network of maximum entropy is the most
            complex, or random, given the specified structure. We found
            that the heuristic maximum entropy model based on
            connectance did not predict the structure of sampled food
            webs very well. However, the heuristic maximum entropy model
            based on the entire joint degree sequence, i.e. on the
            number of prey and predators for each species, gave more
            convincing results. Indeed, this model reproduced food-web
            structure surprisingly well, including the highly
            informative motifs profile. Nevertheless, it was not able to
            predict realistic food-chain lengths.</p>
            <p>Our results bring to the forefront the role of the joint
            degree distribution in shaping food-web structure. This
            echoes the work of <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Fortuna2010NesMod">Fortuna <em>et al.</em>
            (2010)</span>, who found that the degree distribution of
            ecological networks drive their emerging structure such as
            their nestedness and modularity. Network ecologists tend to
            focus on several measures of food webs when studying the
            ecological consequences of their structure <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="McCann2011FooWeb Delmas2019AnaEco">(McCann 2011;
            Delmas <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span>. In fact, following
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Williams2011BioMet">Williams (2011)</span>, we
            believe there is a lot more ecological information in the
            deviation between these properties in empirical systems and
            in their maximum entropy configuration given a fixed joint
            degree sequence.</p>
            <h2 id="alternative-maxent-models">Alternative MaxEnt
            models</h2>
            <p>In this contribution, we used a method based on simulated
            annealing to find the network configuration with the highest
            SVD entropy while fixing some aspects of its structure.
            However, there are different ways to generate adjacency
            matrices using MaxEnt. Another technique, also based on
            simulated annealing, could begin by generating a food web
            randomly with fixed numbers of species and interactions and
            calculating its joint degree distribution. Pairs of
            interactions could then be swapped sequentially until we
            minimize the divergence between the calculated joint degree
            distribution and the one of maximum entropy obtained
            analytically. In that case, this is the entropy of the joint
            degree distribution that would be maximized, not the one of
            the network’s topology. To a certain extent, this method
            would thus bridge the gap between the analytical and
            heuristic approaches presented in this article. More
            research is needed to compare the quality of different
            methods generating adjacency matrices of food webs using
            MaxEnt.</p>
            <p>Maximum entropy graph models are another type of methods
            that predict a distribution of adjacency matrices under soft
            or hard constraints <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Park2004StaMeca Cimini2019StaPhy">(e.g., Park
            &amp; Newman 2004; Cimini <em>et al.</em> 2019)</span>.
            Under hard constraints, every network with a non-zero
            probability exactly satisfies the constraints on its
            structure. This is in contrast with soft constraints, which
            require that networks satisfy them on average (i.e. many
            networks with a non-zero probability do not have the exact
            structure set by the constraints). Maximum entropy graph
            models are helpful because they can provide probability
            distributions for many network properties by measuring the
            structure of all adjacency matrices with a non-zero
            probability. However, we consider that our approach based on
            simulated annealing is more flexible and more
            computationally efficient. Indeed, many measures of food-web
            structure are hard to translate into mathematical
            constraints. Moreover, because food webs are directed
            networks that can have self-loops, it makes the mathematical
            derivation of maximum entropy graph models difficult. We
            believe that identifying heuristically what really
            constrains the topology of food webs is a useful first step
            before attempting to derive the mathematical formulation of
            a maximum entropy graph model for food webs.</p>
            <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
            <p>Our analytical and heuristic models can be applied for
            different purposes. First, they could be used to generate
            first-order approximations of a network’s properties when
            state variables are known empirically. For example, knowing
            the number of species in an ecological community, we can
            predict its number of interactions using the flexible links
            model and then predict its joint degree distribution with
            minimal biases using the principle of maximum entropy. This
            could prove particularly useful when predicting network
            structure at large spatial scales, subdividing the study
            area into smaller communities (e.g., grid cells). Indeed,
            because species richness and other ecological data are
            increasingly abundant <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Dickinson2010CitSci">(e.g., Dickinson <em>et
            al.</em> 2010)</span>, validated MaxEnt models can be used
            to respond to a wider range of macroecological questions
            regarding food webs.</p>
            <p>Second, our analytical model can be used to generate
            informative priors in Bayesian analyses of the structure of
            ecological networks <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Cirtwill2019QuaFrac">(e.g., Cirtwill <em>et
            al.</em> 2019)</span>. Indeed, the probability distribution
            of maximum entropy derived using MaxEnt can be used as a
            prior that can be constantly updated with novel data. For
            instance, if we know the number of species and the number of
            interactions, we can get the degree distribution of maximum
            entropy, as shown in this contribution. The degree
            distribution represents the probability that a species can
            interact (as a predator or a prey) with a number of other
            species. Data on species interactions can be used to update
            the prior degree distribution to generate a more accurate
            posterior distribution, thus improving our description and
            understanding of the system.</p>
            <p>Third, our analytical and heuristic models can be used to
            make better predictions of pairwise species interactions by
            constraining the space of feasible networks, as discussed in
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021a)</span>. In other words, we can use the network
            configuration and/or specific measures of food-web structure
            derived using MaxEnt to ensure that our predictions of
            interspecific interactions form feasible networks. This
            means that the probability that two species interact can be
            conditional on the network structure and on the probability
            of interactions of all other species pairs. For that
            purpose, MaxEnt can be used to predict network structure
            when other data is lacking.</p>
            <p>Finally, our analytical and heuristic models can be used
            as alternative null models of ecological networks to better
            understand and identify the ecological processes driving
            food-web structure. Indeed, these mechanisms can be better
            described when analysing the deviation of empirical data
            from MaxEnt predictions. A strong deviation would indicate
            that ecological mechanisms not encoded in the statistical
            constraints are at play for the system at hand. If
            deviations are systematic, the maximum entropy model might
            need to be revised to include appropriate ecological
            constraints. This revision process helps us reflect on and
            identify what really constrains food-web structure. However,
            it is important to note here that tangible ecological
            mechanisms cannot be directly inferred from statistical
            distributions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="WarrenII2022SeeSha">(Warren II <em>et al.</em>
            2022)</span>. Instead, by identifying the constraints of a
            system and by analysing empirical deviations from maximum
            entropy predictions, MaxEnt can only help us redirect
            research efforts towards understanding the biological
            mechanisms behind these constraints.</p>
            <p>The principle of maximum entropy can thus be applied for
            both the prediction and understanding of natural systems.
            Therefore, the model interpretation depends on how we use
            it. It can be used as a baseline distribution to identify
            the ecological constraints organizing natural systems. It
            can also be used as predictions of ecological systems. This
            distinction between understanding and predicting is
            essential when using and interpreting MaxEnt models.</p>
            <h2 id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges in using the principle of
            maximum entropy is to identify the set of state variables
            that best reproduce empirical data. We found that the number
            of species and the number of interactions are important
            state variables for the prediction of the joint degree
            distribution. Similarly, we found that the numbers of prey
            and predators for each species in a food web are important
            state variables for the prediction of the network
            configuration. However, our predictions overestimated the
            symmetry of the joint degree distribution for our analytical
            model and the maximum trophic level and network diameter for
            our heuristic model. We should thus continue to play the
            ecological detective to find these other topological
            constraints that would improve the predictions of MaxEnt
            models and help us understand better what really drives
            food-web structure.</p>
